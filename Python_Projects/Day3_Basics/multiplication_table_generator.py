#     This is a generator automation pattern.
#     INPUT → LOOP → PROCESS → OUTPUT
# This pattern is used in real automation:

# • Generate reports
# • Generate invoices
# • Generate railway maintenance schedules
# • Generate payroll slips
# • Generate automated messages

# Loop does it automatically.

# This is core of automation.
